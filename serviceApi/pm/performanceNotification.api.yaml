    Performance Monitoring allows the Buyer/Client to provision entities that
    define performance objectives (Performance Profile, Performance Job),
    collect monitoring data (Performance Report), as well as receive
    notifications about these objects. This allows managing issues and 
    situations that are not part of normal operations of the Service provided 
    by the Seller.

    List of supported use cases:
    - Send Event Notification
