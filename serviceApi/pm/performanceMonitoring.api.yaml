    **This API implements part of Business Requirements & Use Cases described
    in Mplify 133.1.**

    Mplify Performance Monitoring API allows to manage Performance Profiles, 
    Performance Jobs and collect Performance Reports, as well as receive 
    notifications related to these entities. This enables the management 
    of performance objectives typically associated with SLS, the on-demand
    collection of performance data, and the retrieval of passive statistics.

    Three types of performance-related entities are supported by the API:
    - **Performance Monitoring Profile** - templates used to simplify the 
      Performance Monitoring Job provisioning. Common attributes for PM Jobs
      are defined in the PM Profile. One PM Profile can be used by multiple
      PM Jobs but PM Jobs can also be created without relationship to PM Profile.

    - **Performance Monitoring Job** - provisions the performance monitoring
      objectives specific to each subject of monitoring which could be a service, 
      an ordered pair (e.g., two UNIs), or an entity (e.g., port).

    - **Performance Monitoring Report** - the execution of PM Job results in
      Performance Monitoring Report that provide Buyer/Client with 
      performance objective results. In some cases, PM Report may be triggered
      by a request from the Buyer/Client without being linked to a Performance
      Job, which applies when retrieving data that already exists 
      in the performance data database.

        The Buyer/Client requests a list of PM Jobs based on a set of filter
        criteria. The Seller/Server returns a summarized list of PM  Jobs. For
        each PM Job returned, the Seller/Server also provides a  Performance
        Job Identifier that uniquely identifies this PM Job within the
        Seller/Server. The order of the elements returned to the  Buyer/Client
        is defined by the Seller/Server (e.g. natural order) and does not
        change between the pages.
