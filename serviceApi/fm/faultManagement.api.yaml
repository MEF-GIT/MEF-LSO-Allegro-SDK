    **This API implements part of Business Requirements & Use Cases described
    in Mplify 133.1.**

    Mplify Fault Management API allows to manage Fault Management Jobs, collect 
    Fault Management Reports, as well as receive notifications related to these
    entities. This provides the ability for the Buyer/Client to request that 
    the Seller/Server performs actions defined by FM Job, and to retrieve 
    the results of the Job. Examples of the Fault Management Job are Link Trace 
    and Loopback. 

    Two types of entities are supported by the API:
    - **Fault Management Job** - specifies the Fault Management Job
      configuration. FM Job is typically run as part of a troubleshooting or 
      diagnostic process of a service, an ordered pair (e.g., two UNIs), 
      or an entity (e.g., port). 

    - **Fault Management Report** - The execution of Fault Management Job 
      results in Fault Management Reports that provide Buyer/Client with the 
      job results.

    List of use cases supported by the API:
    - Create Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve list of Fault Management Jobs
    - Retrieve Fault Management Job by Identifier
    - Modify Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve list of Modify Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve Modify Fault Management Job by Identifier
    - Cancel Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve list of Cancel Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve Cancel Fault Management Job by Identifier
    - Suspend Fault Management Job
    - Resume Fault Management Job
    - Subscribe to Fault Management Job Notifications
    - Unsubscribe from Fault Management Job Notifications
    - Retrieve list of Fault Management Reports
    - Retrieve Fault Management Report by Identifier
    - Subscribe to Fault Management Report Notifications

        The Buyer/Client requests a list of FM Jobs based on a set of filter
        criteria. The Seller/Server returns a summarized list of FM  Jobs. For
        each FM Job returned, the Seller/Server also provides a  Fault
        Management Job Identifier that uniquely identifies this FM Job  within
        the Seller/Server. The order of the elements returned to the
        Buyer/Client is defined by the Seller/Server (e.g. natural order) and
        does not change between the pages.
