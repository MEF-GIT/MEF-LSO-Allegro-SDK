        The Buyer/Client requests a list of Test Jobs using none or more of the
        filter criteria. The Seller/Server returns a summarized list of Test
        Jobs. For each Test Job returned, the Seller/Server also provides a Test
        Job Identifier that uniquely identifiers this Test Job within the
        Seller/Server. The order of the elements returned to the Buyer/Client is
        defined by the Seller/Server (e.g. natural order) and does not change
        between the pages.
