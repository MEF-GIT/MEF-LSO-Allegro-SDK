        | acknowledged | A `ServiceOrder` request has been received and has passed message and basic validations and a _Success Response_ has been sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
        | rejected     | This state indicates that: <br>- Invalid information is provided through the `ServiceOrder` / `ServiceOrderItem` request <br>- The request fails to meet validation rules for `Service` delivery (processing) <br>If one `ServiceOrderItem` is rejected, then the entire `ServiceOrder` request is rejected and a _Error Response_ is sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
        | inProgress   | This state indicates that all `ServiceOrderItems` have successfully passed the validations checks and the scheduled `Service` delivery/processing has started. <br> The `ServiceOrder` will be in _`inProgress`_ state if _at least one_ `ServiceOrderItem` is in _`inProgress`_ state                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
        | pending      | This state indicates that a `ServiceOrderItem` is currently in a waiting stage for an action/activity to be completed before the order-processing can progress further, pending order amend or cancel assessment. <br> A _`pending`_ state can lead into auto cancellation of an `ServiceOrderItem`, if no action is taken within the agreed timeframe.<br>The `ServiceOrder` will be in _`pending`_ state if _at least one_ `ServiceOrderItem` is in _`pending`_ state                                                                               |
        | held         | This state indicates that a `ServiceOrderItem` cannot be progressed due to an issue. The `Service` delivery (processing) has been temporarily delayed to resolve an infrastructure shortfall to facilitate supply of order. Upon resolution of the issue, the `ServiceOrderItem` will continue to progress.<br> A _`held`_ state can lead into auto cancellation of an `ServiceOrderItem`, if no action is taken within the agreed timeframe.<br>The `ServiceOrder` will be in _`held`_ state if at least one `ServiceOrderItem` is in _`held`_ state |
        | failed       | This state indicates that `Service` delivery (processing) associated with a `ServiceOrderItem` has failed. This indicates an irrecoverable error as opposed to _`held`_ or _`pending`_ issues.<br>The `ServiceOrder` will be in _`failed`_ state if at _ALL_ `ServiceOrderItems` are in _`failed`_ state                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
        | completed    | This state indicates that `Service` delivery (processing) associated with a `ServiceOrderItem` has completed. <br>The `ServiceOrder` will be in _`completed`_ state if at _ALL_ `ServiceOrderItems` are in _`completed`_ state                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
        | partial      | This state indicates that some `ServiceOrderItem` are in _`completed`_ state while others are in _`cancelled`_ and/or _`failed`_ states, so the entire `ServiceOrder` is in a _`partial`_ state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
