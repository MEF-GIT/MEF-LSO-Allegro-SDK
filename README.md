## Introduction

All references to 'MEF Forum' or 'MEF' in the release documentation, links, and
YAML files should be interpreted as references to 'Mplify Alliance' and
'Mplify' respectively. Since this release coincides with the transition of the
name of MEF Forum to Mplify Alliance, changes were not made to all the files in
this release. Standards that were already published will retain the "MEF" name.

## Overview

This repository contains the release of the Allegro SDK. The SDK includes APIs
for Service Order, Service Inventory, Performance Monitoring, and Streaming
Management functions of the Service Orchestration Functionality (SOF) at the
LSO Allegro Interface Reference Point (IRP) as defined in the Mplify LSO
Reference Architecture.

Also included are Service schemas and Performance Monitoring definitions.

## Maturity Level

The API files contained in this SDK are evolving and subject to change. They
are based on documents that are either work in progress or draft standards that
have not yet completed the review cycles and approvals necessary to achieve the
