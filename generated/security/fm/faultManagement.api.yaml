  description: "**This file forms part of MEF W148**\n\n**This API implements part\
    \ of Business Requirements & Use Cases described\nin MEF W133.1.**\n\n**This specification\
    \ represents MEF work in progress and is subject to\nchange.**\n\nMEF Fault Management\
    \ API allows to manage Fault Management Jobs, collect \nFault Management Reports,\
    \ as well as receive notifications related to these\nentities. This provides the\
    \ ability for the Buyer/Client to request that \nthe Seller/Server performs actions\
    \ defined by FM Job, and to retrieve \nthe results of the Job. Examples of the\
    \ Fault Management Job are Link Trace \nand Loopback. \n\nTwo types of entities\
    \ are supported by the API:\n- **Fault Management Job** - specifies the Fault\
    \ Management Job\n  configuration. FM Job is typically run as part of a troubleshooting\
    \ or \n  diagnostic process of a service, an ordered pair (e.g., two UNIs), \n\
    \  or an entity (e.g., port). \n\n- **Fault Management Report** - The execution\
    \ of Fault Management Job \n  results in Fault Management Reports that provide\
    \ Buyer/Client with the \n  job results.\n\nList of use cases supported by the\
    \ API:\n- Create Fault Management Job\n- Retrieve list of Fault Management Jobs\n\
    - Retrieve Fault Management Job by Identifier\n- Modify Fault Management Job\n\
    - Retrieve list of Modify Fault Management Job\n- Retrieve Modify Fault Management\
    \ Job by Identifier\n- Cancel Fault Management Job\n- Retrieve list of Cancel\
    \ Fault Management Job\n- Retrieve Cancel Fault Management Job by Identifier\n\
    - Suspend Fault Management Job\n- Resume Fault Management Job\n- Subscribe to\
    \ Fault Management Job Notifications\n- Unsubscribe from Fault Management Job\
    \ Notifications\n- Retrieve list of Fault Management Reports\n- Retrieve Fault\
    \ Management Report by Identifier\n- Subscribe to Fault Management Report Notifications\n\
