      description: The Service Level Specification Service Attribute (SLS) is, as part of the Service Level Agreement, the technical details of the service level, in terms of Performance Objectives, agreed between the Service Provider and the Subscriber for Subscriber Ethernet Services and between the SP/SO and Operator for Operator Ethernet Services. . A given SLS might contain 0, 1, or more Performance Objectives for each Performance Metric. The SLS is described in section 8.8 (EVC Service Level Specification Service Attribute) of MEF 10.4 for EVCs and section 12.13 (OVC Service Level Specification Service Attribute) for OVCs. MEF 10.4 defines 10 Performance Metrics (all of which are included here). MEF 26.2 defines only 9 Performance Metrics. MEF 26.2 does not include the One Way Composite PM. The other 9 are the same.

          description: MEF 10.4 sec. 8.8.10 - oneWayCompositePmMetric is a reference to zero or more instances of One Way Composite Performance Metric. Each reference contains a set of parameters and performance objective for the Performance Metric. If there are 0 instances then this Class of Service does not have an objective for One Way Composite Performance. If there are multiple instances for this Class of Service then at least one of the parameters must be different between the instances.

        deltaT:
          description: MEF 10.4 sec. 8.8 and MEF 26.2 sec. 12.13 - deltaT is a time duration in seconds much smaller than timeInterval. This is used, primarily, in calculations associated with Availability, High Loss Intervals and Consecutive High Loss Intervals. MEF 10.4 and MEF 26.2 refer to this as ?t and the k-th interval starting at ts is referred to as ?tk (k is subscript).
