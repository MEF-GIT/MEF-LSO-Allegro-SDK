      or disabled, (3) whether PTP is used on the link, (4) UNI connector
      type, (6) the UNI connector gender, and (6) whether autonegotiation

          MEF 10.4 Section 9.2 and Section 9.3 When the value of the Subscriber UNI 
          Instantiation Service Attribute equals Virtual, there must exist a map
          that maps the set of Virtual Frames that cross the UNI to a sequence of pairs
          of the for <s,t> where s is a standard Ethernet frame per Clause 3 of IEEE
          Std 802.3 - 2015 and t is the arrival time at the UNI for bits in s.

          Since MEF 10.4 does not specify the contents or format of this map, it is 
          currently defined as an arbitrary length string.
