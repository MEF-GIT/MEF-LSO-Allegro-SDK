      The Subscriber L1VC Service Level Specification (SLS) Service Attribute is the technical
      specification of aspects of the service performance agreed to by the Service Provider and
      the Subscriber. For any given SLS, a given Performance Metric may or may not specified.

    properties:
      startTime:
        $ref: '#/definitions/TimeAndDate'
        description: >-
          StartTime is a time that represents the date and time for the start of the SLS. 
          MEF 63: [R22] t-start MUST be specified to the nearest second. MEF 64: [R30] 
          t-start MUST be specified to the nearest second.
      duration:
        $ref: '#/definitions/TimeIntervalTs'
        description: >-
          Duration is a duration that is used in conjunction with ts to specify a contiguous 
          sequence of time intervals for determining when performance objectives are met. 
          The units for T are not constrained.

            The One-way Delay for the L1CI that ingresses at UNI 1 and that egresses at UNI 2 
            is defined as the time elapsed from the reception of the first bit of the ingress 
            L1CI at UNI 1 until the reception of that first bit of the corresponding L1CI 
            egressing at UNI 2. Reference MEF 63 Section 8.2.3.3 One-way Delay Performance Metric.

            one or more bits are in error. Reference MEF 63 Section 8.2.3.4 One-way Errored
            Second Performance Metric.
