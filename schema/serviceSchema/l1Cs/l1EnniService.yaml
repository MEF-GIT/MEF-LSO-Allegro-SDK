  For each instance of an ENNI, there are multiple sets of ENNI Service Attributes. 
  The value for each ENNI Service Attribute in a set for an Operator network is 
  specific to the SP/SO that is using the ENNI. Reference MEF 64 Section 8.2 ENNI 
  Service Attributes.

      The Operator ENNI Identifier Service Attribute value is a string used to allow 
      the SP/SO and Operator to uniquely identify the ENNI. Reference MEF 64 Section 
      8.2.1 Operator ENNI Identifier Service Attribute.

      (two-stage), or more multiplexing stages. Reference MEF 64 Section 8.2.2 Operator

      Service Attribute is List, the entries are the overhead values corresponding to 
      each of the SHO/HO/LO ODU paths carried across an ENNI which is terminated in 
      an Operator’s network. Reference MEF 64 Section 8.2.3 Operator Path Overhead 
      Service Attribute.
