## Release Kylie:

**NOTE**:

All references to 'MEF Forum' or 'MEF' in the documentation and YAML files should be interpreted to be references to 'Mplify Alliance' and 'Mplify' respectively.  Since the approval process for this standard and associated assets coincides with the transition of the name of MEF Forum to Mplify Alliance, changes were not made to the files on this release.

**Readiness status**: Letter Ballot - proposed

**Summary**:
 
 - Mplify W102 YAML schemas are now Letter Ballot.

 - Mplify W102 provides a set of Postman scripts for testing the set of REST operations with valid Mplify W102 payloads.
 
 - Alignment of data types used in Internet Protocol Service Schemas with Internet Protocol Product Schemas.

## Maturity Level

The schema files contained in this repository are evolving and subject to change. They are
based on documents that are either ratified standards or draft standards that
have not yet completed the review cycles and approvals necessary to achieve the
status as a Mplify standard. Mplify is making these publicly available at this time to
invite wider industry review.

- IP Service Attributes:
  - MEF 61.1 - **Published Standard**
- UNI Access Link Trunk, IP Addresses, and Mean Time to Repair Performance Metric Service
  - MEF 61.1.1 - **Published Standard**
