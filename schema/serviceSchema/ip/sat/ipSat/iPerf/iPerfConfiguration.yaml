  Affinity: 
    type: object
    description: >-
      Set the CPU affinity, if possible (Linux and FreeBSD only). On both the client and
      server you can set the local affinity by using the n form of this argument (where n
      is a CPU number). In addition, on the client you can override the server's affinity 
      for just that one test, using the n,m form of argument. Note that when using this 
      feature, a process will only be bound to a single CPU (as opposed to a set containing
      potentially multiple CPUs).
    properties:

      bandwidth:

        description: >-
          Sets the interval time in seconds between periodic bandwidth, jitter, and 
          loss reports. If non-zero, a report is made every interval seconds of the
          bandwidth since the last report. If zero, no periodic reports are printed.
          Default is zero.
