    description:
      The IPVC Service Level Specification (SLS) describes the performance
      objectives for the performance of conformant IP Data Packets that flow
      over the IPVC. The IPVC Service Level Specification Attribute is either
      None, or a four-tuple of the form (s,T,E,L) where s is the start time, T
      is a period of time, E is a set of SLS entries and L is a set of the CoS
      Name and number of other parameters specific to the Performance Metric.
      Reference MEF 61.1 Section 10.9 IPVC Service Level Specification Service
      Attribute.

    description:
      Service Level Specification Reference Point Pair. In a multipoint or
      rooted multipoint IPVC, performance objectives are ideally specified as
      applying between pairs of IPVC EPs - in other words, they apply to the
      performance that IP Data Packets experience as they flow from one EI to
      another. The SlsRpPair is a representation of this association. Reference
