  An ENNI can comprise one or more distinct IP Links, each of which is a single IP hop. 
  These links are known as ENNI Links, and typically each corresponds to a distinct IP 
  subnet (which can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing).  ENNI Links are assumed to be 
  point-to-point. Reference MEF 61.1 Section 8.2 ENNIs and ENNI Links.
