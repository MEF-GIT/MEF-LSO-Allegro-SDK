  A CarrierEthernetEvcEndPoint is a construct at a UNI that selects a subset of
  the Service Frames that pass over the UNI. A CarrierEthernetEvcEndPoint
  represents the  logical attachment of an EVC to a UNI. Reference MEF 10.4
  Section 10 EVC EP Service  Attributes. NOTE-CarrierEthernetEvcEndPoint
  inherits from CarrierEthernetServiceEndPoint.

      MEF 10.4 sec. 10.4 - This is specifications for which Service Frames are
      mapped to the EVC End Point. The allowed values in MEF 10.4 are ALL,
      LIST, and UT/PT. Since Private services must be ALL, the map isn't needed
      for those services, and therefore the type does not include ALL. If the
      type is LIST there must be a list of VLAN IDs specified.
