## Introduction

This repository contains the Mplify LSO Carrier Ethernet Service YAML payload schemas. The set of YAML
schemas to support Mplify W101 include:

- Subscriber UNI
- Subscriber EVC End Point
- Subscriber EVC
- Operator UNI
- Operator OVC End Point
- Operator OVC
- ENNI
- ENNI Service
- Virtual UNI
- Carrier Ethernet Service Level Specification (SLS)
- Carrier Ethernet Common

## Release Janis:

**NOTE**:

All references to 'MEF Forum' or 'MEF' in the documentation and YAML files should be interpreted to be references to 'Mplify Alliance' and 'Mplify' respectively.  Since the approval process for this standard and associated assets coincides with the transition of the name of MEF Forum to Mplify Alliance, changes were not made to the files on this release.

**Readiness status**: Letter Ballot - proposed

**Summary**:
 
 - Mplify W101 YAML schemas are now Letter Ballot.

 - Mplify W101 provides a set of Postman scripts for testing the set of REST operations with valid Mplify W101 payloads.
 
 - Alignment of data types used in Carrier Ethernet Service Schemas with Carrier Ethernet Product Schemas.

## Maturity Level

The schema files contained in this repository are evolving and subject to change. They are
based on documents that are either ratified standards or draft standards that
have not yet completed the review cycles and approvals necessary to achieve the
status as a Mplify standard. Mplify is making these publicly available at this time to
invite wider industry review.
