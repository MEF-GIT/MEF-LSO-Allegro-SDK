      Enumeration representing IPv4 Address Types specific for UNI Access Links.

      - DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used the Subscriber
      devices 

      to request IPv4 addresses in a given subnet from the SP or Operator.

      - STATIC: IPv4 addresses in a given IPv4 subnet are statically assigned to
      the 

      SP or Operator and to the Subscriber.

      - UNNUMBERED: The SP or Operator and the Subscriber each assigned an IPv4
      address

      (from their own address pools) independently. These addresses can be on
      different 

      subnets, and so an interface-based routing protocol is needed to ensure
      reachability.
